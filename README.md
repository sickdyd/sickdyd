### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Developer working in Tokyo. I started programming when I was a kid with the Commodore 16. I then moved on to Turbo Pascal and Visual Basic to build simple 2D games. Since 2004 I have been doing mainly web development.

I'm contribuiting with a few NPM packages to the Open Source Community with the hope of giving something back.

Hit me with an email if you like, and let me know more about you! >D
